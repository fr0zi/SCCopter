SC2 file description taken from https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/pc/198648-simcity-2000/faqs/2100

14)The structure of a "SC2" file.
=======================
First of all, SimCity files are in `IFF format', which means that they
consist of an 12-byte file header followed by a series of segments. The
file header format is as follows:

Bytes 1-4:  'FORM' (indicates an IFF file)
Bytes 5-8:  Total count of bytes in file, except for the first 8 bytes in
this header
Bytes 9-12: File type: in the case of SimCity 2000, 'SCDH'

Each segment has an 8-byte header:

Bytes 1-4: Type of segment
Byres 5-8: Number of bytes in this segment, except for this 8-byte header

The remaining bytes in each segment are data.

The data in most SimCity segments is compressed using a form of
run-length encoding.  When this is done, the data in the segment consists
of a series of chunks of two kinds.  The first kind of chunk has first
byte from 1 to 127;  in this case the first byte is a count telling how
many data bytes follow.  The second kind of chunk has first byte from 129
to 255.  In this
case, if you subtract 127 from the first byte, you get a count telling
how many times the following single data byte is repeated.  Chunks with
first byte 0 or 128 never seem to occur.

SimCity files consist of the following segment types, in order, with the
following lengths.  Except as noted, segments are compressed as above,and
the length given for them is the length after uncompression; the
compressed length may vary.

Some remarks about the data in the individual segments:

ALTM:  Altitude map.  Uncompressed.  Contains two bytes for each square.
       (For our purposes, we will define `left', `right', `top', and
`bottom' by saying that squares are scanned by rows from top to bottom,
and from right to left within each row.)
       Taking each two bytes as a 16-bit integer, MSB first, bits 4-0
give the altitude of the square, from 50 to 3150 feet.  Bit 7
seems to be set if the square is covered with water.  I do not know
what bits 15-8 and 6-5 do.

CNAM:  City name.  Uncompressed.  Seems to be optional.  When it is
present, it consists of a length byte from 0 to 31, followed by that many
bytes of city name.  It is padded out to 32 bytes with zeroes.

MISC:  This probably contains global information.  Bytes 20-23 are the
amount of money you have as a 4-byte integer, MSB first. 

XBIT:  One byte of flags per square.

Bit 7: Electrically conductive?
    6: Powered?
    5: Piped? (i.e., permeable to water?)
    4: Supplied with water?
    3: ???
    2: Covered with water? (i.e., part of a lake, river, or ocean?)
    1: ???
    0: Does placing water here give salt water?

XBLD:  One code byte per square, describing what's on it.  (In general,
to put a building or whatever up and have a consistent       resultant
simulation, you have to do a lot more than change this array.)

The codes in this list are in hexadecimal.

Non-buildings:

00: Clear terrain (empty)
01-04: Rubble
05: Radioactive waste
06-0C: Trees (density increases as code increases)
0D: Small park (set XZON as for a 1x1 building)
0E-1C: Power lines (various directions, slopes) The difference X between
the code and 0E, the first code, tells what direction(s) and slope the
power line takes.

   X (in hex)  Direction
   0           Left-right [for definition of directions, see note with
ALTM]
   1           Top-bottom

   3           Left-right; slopes upwards towards right 
   4           Top-bottom; slopes upwards towards bottom

   7           Bottom to left
   8           Left to top
   9           Top to right
   A           T junction between top, right and bottom

Rails (various directions, slopes; same coding as for 0E-1C) 3B-3E: More
sloping rails. These are used as preparation before ascending. The 2C-3A
rail codes are used on the actual sloping square.  This is why rails
don't look right when ascending a 1:1 grade.

XTER:  One code byte per square.  Tells whether there is land or water in
the square and how the terrain slopes.  To describe here how terrain
slopes, we write four numbers in a square:

       a b
       c d

       Here, a, b, c and d are the relative heights of the corners of
       the square.
               
       Codes in hex:

       00-0D:  Dry land, with various slopes:
         00: 00    01: 11    02: 01    03: 00    04: 10    05: 11
             00        00        01        11        10        01
         06: 01    07: 10    08: 11    09: 01    0A: 00    0B: 00
             11        11        10        00        01        10
         0C: 10    0D: 11
             00        11
       0E-0F:  Unused?
       10-1D:  Slopes as for 00-0D.  However, instead of being dry land,
               the square is totally submerged in water.
       1E-1F:  Unused?
       20-2D:  As for 10-1D, but the square is submerged only to a level
               slightly less than height 1, so that for e.g. square type 21
               the square to the top would probably be dry land.
       2E:     Unused?
       2F:     Unused?
       30-3D:  As for 20-2D, but the square is not submerged at all; 
               it just has water on its surface, as when you place it by 
               the `water' tool in SimCity 2000.  It is still true that
               for e.g. square type 31, the square to the top would be
               dry land and the other adjacent squares water.
       3E: Waterfall.
       3F: Unused?
       40: Surf. water `canal', running left-right.  Land at top and bottom.
       41: Surf. water `canal', running top-bottom.  Land at left and right.
       42: Surf. water `bay', open to the bottom.  Land at left, top & right.
       43: Surf. water `bay', open to the left.  Land at top, right & bottom.
       44: Surf. water `bay', open to the top.  Land at left, right & bottom.
       45: Surf. water `bay', open to the bottom.  Land at top, left & right.
       46-FF: Unused?

XUND:  One code byte per square.  Tells what's in the square under the ground.

Codes in hex:

00: Nothing
01-0F: Subway, various directions & slopes (coded as for XTER, codes 0E-1C)
10-1E: Pipes, various directions & slopes (coded as for XTER, codes 0E-1C)
1F: Pipe/subway crossover: pipe top-bottom, subway left-right 
20: Pipe/subway crossover: pipe left-right, subway top-bottom
21-22: ???
23: Sub/rail or subway station
24-FF: Unused?

XZON:  One byte per square.  Bits 7, 6, 5, and 4 should be set at the
upper left, lower left, lower right, and upper right corners of a
building. For a 1x1 building, of course, all these bits should be set at
the location of the building.  Bits 3-0 code the zoning for the square,
as follows:

0: None
1: Light residential
2: Dense residential
3: Light commercial
4: Dense commercial
5: Light industrial
6: Dense industrial
7: Military base
8: Airport
9: Seaport
10-15: Unused?
